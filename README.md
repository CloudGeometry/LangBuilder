## The 3 Essential Layers of Enterprise AI Transformationa

### Unified in the LangBuilder AIAgent Platform to enable step-by-step, accurate AI Agent adoption in your business processes

1.  **Visual Editor and Workflow Designer**
  
An intuitive, no-code drag-and-drop IDE for business users and project managers to quickly prototype and validate AI workflows

-   Prebuilt connectors to popular and domain specific data sources, and APIs
-   Choose your own LLM: OpenAI/Claude/Bedrock/Gemini and local Mistral/LLaMA/Falcon/++
-   RAG pipelines and Vector DBs for adding your business internal and domain knowledge
-   Playground mode for fast experimentation and concept validation before scaling
-   Access controls and roles for secure collaboration

-   Prebuilt components and primitives
-   Full support for memory integration, including short-term session and long-term memory out of the box
-   Multi‚Äëagent orchestration; use handoffs or supervisor/swarm patterns for complex workflow
-   Rich API layer, including Control Plane & Data Plane APIs
-   Robust concurrency and reliability

Based on the popular LangChain open source project framework and LangFlow builder, with CloudGeometry AddOns enabling a seamless transition from rapid prototyping to enterprise ready and secure agents

3.  **AI Agent Deployment & Management Platform**
    
For operations teams and business analysts who need production-ready tools for AI powered processes governance, cost optimization, and continuous improvement

-   Cloud deployment with built-in CI/CD
-   Built-in task queues and auto-scaling
-   Checkpointers and memory storage
-   Scalability and fault tolerance
-   AI Quality Control AddOns
-   Cost Control, Cloud, Data, Tokens
-   Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop support‚Äîpause workflows for manual intervention at any stage  

Based on the popular open source projects LangGraph and Kubernetes with CloudGeometry components for quick deployment, observability and cost control.
