# LangBuilder AI Agent Platform ‚Äî Open Source, Enterprise-Ready, Yours to Own

-   Deploy on your cloud, VPC, or even OnPrem
-   No-code, Low-code and LangChain-based Framework
-   AI Agents Libraries and Templates

CloudGeometry provides end-to-end support for platform deployment, maintenance, and AI Agent adoption through our managed services plans

## The 3 Essential Layers of Enterprise AI Transformationa

### Unified in the LangBuilder AIAgent Platform to enable step-by-step, accurate AI Agent adoption in your business processes

1.  **Visual Editor and Workflow Designer**

An intuitive, no-code drag-and-drop IDE for business users and project managers to quickly prototype and validate AI workflows

-   Prebuilt connectors to popular and domain specific data sources, and APIs
-   Choose your own LLM: OpenAI/Claude/Bedrock/Gemini and local Mistral/LLaMA/Falcon/++
-   RAG pipelines and Vector DBs for adding your business internal and domain knowledge
-   Playground mode for fast experimentation and concept validation before scaling
-   Access controls and roles for secure collaboration
-   Reusable agent templates‚Äîe.g., for customer support, copilots, process automation, and other common use cases

Based on the popular LangFlow OpenSource project with CloudGeometry AddOns enabling you to continuously run those AI Agents for your company's internal processes.

2.  **Programmable AI Agent Framework**

For LLM developers to extend agents with custom logic, integrations, and advanced orchestration

-   LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for precise, expressive orchestration logic
-   Prebuilt components and primitives
-   Full support for memory integration, including short-term session and long-term memory out of the box
-   Multi‚Äëagent orchestration; use handoffs or supervisor/swarm patterns for complex workflow
-   Rich API layer, including Control Plane & Data Plane APIs
-   Robust concurrency and reliability

Based on the popular LangChain open source project framework and LangFlow builder, with CloudGeometry AddOns enabling a seamless transition from rapid prototyping to enterprise ready and secure agents

3.  **AI Agent Deployment & Management Platform**

For operations teams and business analysts who need production-ready tools for AI powered processes governance, cost optimization, and continuous improvement

-   Cloud deployment with built-in CI/CD
-   Built-in task queues and auto-scaling
-   Checkpointers and memory storage
-   Scalability and fault tolerance
-   AI Quality Control AddOns
-   Cost Control, Cloud, Data, Tokens
-   Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop support‚Äîpause workflows for manual intervention at any stage

Based on the popular open source projects LangGraph and Kubernetes with CloudGeometry components for quick deployment, observability and cost control.
