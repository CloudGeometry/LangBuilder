title: Configure an external PostgreSQL database
slug: /configuration-custom-database
---

Langbuilder's default database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html), but you can configure Langbuilder to use PostgreSQL instead.

This guide walks you through setting up an external database for Langbuilder by replacing the default SQLite connection string `sqlite:///./langbuilder.db` with PostgreSQL, both in local and containerized environments.

In this configuration, all structured application data from Langbuilder, including flows, message history, and logs, is instead managed by PostgreSQL.
PostgreSQL is better suited for production environments due to its robust support for concurrent users, advanced data integrity features, and scalability.
Langbuilder can more efficiently handle multiple users and larger workloads by using PostgreSQL as the database.

## Prerequisites

- A [PostgreSQL](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) database

## Connect Langbuilder to a local PostgreSQL database

1. If Langbuilder is running, stop Langbuilder with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>.

2. Find your PostgreSQL database's connection string in the format `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`.

    The hostname in your connection string depends on how you're running PostgreSQL:

    - If you're running PostgreSQL directly on your machine, use `localhost`.
    - If you're running PostgreSQL in Docker Compose, use the service name, such as `postgres`.
    - If you're running PostgreSQL in a separate Docker container with `docker run`, use the container's IP address or network alias.
    - If you're running a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL, your provider will share your connection string, which includes a username and password.

3. Create a Langbuilder `.env` file:

    ```
    touch .env
    ```

    You can use the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/cloudgeometry/langbuilder/blob/main/.env.example) file in the Langbuilder repository as a template for your own `.env` file.

4. In your `.env` file, set `LANGBUILDER_DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL connection string:

    ```text
    LANGBUILDER_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
    ```

5. Save your changes, and then start Langbuilder with your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    uv run langbuilder run --env-file .env
    ```

6. In Langbuilder, run any flow to create traffic.

7. Inspect your PostgreSQL database's tables and activity to verify that new tables and traffic were created after you ran a flow.

## Deploy Langbuilder and PostgreSQL containers with docker-compose.yml

Launching Langbuilder and PostgreSQL containers in the same Docker network ensures proper connectivity between services.
For an example, see the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/cloudgeometry/langbuilder/blob/main/docker_example/docker-compose.yml) file in the Langbuilder repository.

The configuration in the example `docker-compose.yml` also sets up persistent volumes for both Langbuilder and PostgreSQL data.
Persistent volumes map directories inside of containers to storage on the host machine, so data persists through container restarts.

Docker Compose creates an isolated network for all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This ensures that the services can communicate with each other using their service names as hostnames, such as `postgres` in the database URL.
In contrast, if you run PostgreSQL separately with `docker run`, it launches in a different network than the Langbuilder container, and this prevents Langbuilder from connecting to PostgreSQL using the service name.

To start the Langbuilder and PostgreSQL services with the example Docker Compose file, navigate to the `langbuilder/docker_example` directory, and then run `docker-compose up`.
If you're using a different `docker-compose.yml` file, run the `docker-compose up` command from the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Deploy multiple Langbuilder instances with a shared PostgreSQL database

To configure multiple Langbuilder instances that share the same PostgreSQL database, modify your `docker-compose.yml` file to include multiple Langbuilder services.

This example populates the values in `docker-compose.yml` with values from your Langbuilder `.env` file.
This approach means you only have to manage deployment variables in one file, instead of copying values across multiple files.

1. Update your `.env` file with values for your PostgreSQL database:

    ```text
    POSTGRES_USER=langbuilder
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
    POSTGRES_DB=langbuilder
    POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    LANGBUILDER_CONFIG_DIR=app/langbuilder
    LANGBUILDER_PORT_1=7860
    LANGBUILDER_PORT_2=7861
    LANGBUILDER_HOST=0.0.0.0
    ```
2. Reference these variables in your `docker-compose.yml`.
For example:

    ```yaml
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
          - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
        ports:
          - "${POSTGRES_PORT}:5432"
        volumes:
          - langbuilder-postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data

      langbuilder-1:
        image: nickchasecg/langbuilder:latest
        pull_policy: always
        ports:
          - "${LANGBUILDER_PORT_1}:7860"
        depends_on:
          - postgres
        environment:
          - LANGBUILDER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}
          - LANGBUILDER_CONFIG_DIR=${LANGBUILDER_CONFIG_DIR}
          - LANGBUILDER_HOST=${LANGBUILDER_HOST}
          - PORT=7860
        volumes:
          - langbuilder-data-1:/app/langbuilder

      langbuilder-2:
        image: nickchasecg/langbuilder:latest
        pull_policy: always
        ports:
          - "${LANGBUILDER_PORT_2}:7860"
        depends_on:
          - postgres
        environment:
          - LANGBUILDER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}
          - LANGBUILDER_CONFIG_DIR=${LANGBUILDER_CONFIG_DIR}
          - LANGBUILDER_HOST=${LANGBUILDER_HOST}
          - PORT=7860
        volumes:
          - langbuilder-data-2:/app/langbuilder

    volumes:
      langbuilder-postgres:
      langbuilder-data-1:
      langbuilder-data-2:
    ```

3. Deploy the file with `docker-compose up`.
You can access the first Langbuilder instance at `http://localhost:7860`, and the second Langbuilder instance at `http://localhost:7861`.

4. To confirm both instances are using the same database, run the `docker exec` command to start `psql` in your PostgreSQL container.
Your container name may vary.

    ```bash
    docker exec -it docker-test-postgres-1 psql -U langbuilder -d langbuilder
    ```

5. Query the database for active connections:

    ```sql
    langbuilder=# SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'langbuilder';
    ```

6. Examine the query results for multiple connections with different `client_addr` values, for example `172.21.0.3` and `172.21.0.4`.
Since each Langbuilder instance runs in its own container on the Docker network, using different incoming IP addresses confirms that both instances are actively connected to the PostgreSQL database.

7. To quit psql, type `quit`.
