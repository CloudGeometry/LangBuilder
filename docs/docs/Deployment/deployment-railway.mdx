This guide explains how to [deploy Langbuilder on Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=langbuilder), a cloud infrastructure platform that provides auto-deploy, managed databases, and automatic scaling.

1. Create a Railway account.

   A Hobby account on Railway is sufficient for Langbuilder's dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM requirements. For more information, see [Railway pricing](https://railway.com/pricing?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=langbuilder).

2. Follow this link to deploy the Langbuilder template on Railway:

3. Optional: Add any custom configuration for your Langbuilder deployment.

   The Langbuilder Railway template automatically sets up the infrastructure, deploys Langbuilder, and then starts the application.

4. Wait for the deployment to complete.

5. Navigate to your Langbuilder instance at your deployment's public URL, such as `https://APP-NAME.up.railway.app`.
