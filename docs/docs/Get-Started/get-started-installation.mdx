Langbuilder can be installed in multiple ways:

* [**Langbuilder Desktop (Recommended)**](#install-and-run-langbuilder-desktop): Download and install the standalone desktop application for the least complicated setup experience.
This option includes dependency management and facilitated upgrades.

* [**Docker**](#install-and-run-langbuilder-docker): Pull and run the Langbuilder Docker image to start a Langbuilder container and run Langbuilder in isolation.

* [**Python package**](#install-and-run-the-langbuilder-oss-python-package): Install and run the Langbuilder OSS Python package.
This option offers more control over the environment, dependencies, and versioning.

* [**Install from source**](/contributing-how-to-contribute#install-langbuilder-from-source): Use this option if you want to contribute to the Langbuilder codebase or documentation.

## Install and run Langbuilder Desktop

Langbuilder Desktop is a desktop version of Langbuilder that simplifies dependency management and upgrades.

To manage dependencies in Langbuilder Desktop, see [Install custom dependencies in Langbuilder Desktop](/install-custom-dependencies#langbuilder-desktop).

## Install and run Langbuilder with Docker {#install-and-run-langbuilder-docker}

You can use the Langbuilder Docker image to start a Langbuilder container.
For more information, see [Deploy Langbuilder on Docker](/deployment-docker).

1. Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

2. Pull the latest [Langbuilder Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/langbuilderai/langbuilder) and start it:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 7860:7860 langbuilderai/langbuilder:latest
    ```

3. To access Langbuilder, navigate to `http://localhost:7860/`.

4. Create your first flow with the [Quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

## Install and run the Langbuilder OSS Python package

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies and infrastructure:

    - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
       - macOS and Linux: Version 3.10 to 3.13
       - Windows: Version 3.10 to 3.12
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    - Sufficient infrastructure:
       - Minimum: Dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM
       - Recommended: Multi-core CPU and at least 4 GB RAM

2. Create a virtual environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments).

    <details>
    <summary>Need help with virtual environments?</summary>

    Virtual environments ensure Langbuilder is installed in an isolated, fresh environment.
    To create a new virtual environment, do the following.

        <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="linux-macos" label="Linux or macOS" default>

        1. Navigate to where you want your virtual environment to be created, and then create it with `uv`:

            ```shell
            uv venv VENV_NAME
            ```

            Replace `VENV_NAME` with a name for your virtual environment.

        2. Start the virtual environment:

            ```shell
            source VENV_NAME/bin/activate
            ```

            Your shell's prompt changes to display that you're currently working in a virtual environment:

            ```text
            (VENV_NAME) ➜  langbuilder git:(main) ✗
            ```

        3. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your regular shell, type `deactivate`.

            When activated, the virtual environment temporarily modifies your `PATH` variable to prioritize packages installed within the virtual environment.
            To avoid conflicts with other projects, it's a good idea to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done working in it.

            To delete the virtual environment, type `rm -rf VENV_NAME`.
            This completely removes the virtual environment directory and its contents.

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">

        1. Navigate to where you want your virtual environment to be created, and create it with `uv`.

            ```shell
            uv venv VENV_NAME
            ```

            Replace `VENV_NAME` with a name for your virtual environment.

        2. Start the virtual environment:

            ```shell
            VENV_NAME\Scripts\activate
            ```

            Your shell's prompt changes to display that you're currently working in a virtual environment:

            ```text
            (VENV_NAME) PS C:/users/username/langbuilder-dir>
            ```

        3. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your regular shell, type `deactivate`.

            When activated, the virtual environment temporarily modifies your `PATH` variable to prioritize packages installed within the virtual environment.
            To avoid conflicts with other projects, it's a good idea to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done working in it.

            To delete the virtual environment, type `Remove-Item VENV_NAME`.
            This completely removes the virtual environment directory and its contents.

        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

    </details>

3. In your virtual environment, install Langbuilder:

    ```bash
    uv pip install langbuilder
    ```

    To install a specific version of the Langbuilder package by adding the required version to the command, such as `uv pip install langbuilder==1.4.22`.

    <details>
    <summary>Reinstall or upgrade Langbuilder</summary>

    To reinstall Langbuilder and all of its dependencies, run `uv pip install langbuilder --force-reinstall`.

    To upgrade Langbuilder to the latest version, run `uv pip install langbuilder -U`.
    However, the Langbuilder team recommends taking steps to backup your existing installation before you upgrade Langbuilder.
    For more information, see [Prepare to upgrade](/release-notes#prepare-to-upgrade).

    </details>

4. Start Langbuilder:

    ```bash
    uv run langbuilder run
    ```

    It can take a few minutes for Langbuilder to start.

5. To confirm that a local Langbuilder instance is running, navigate to the default Langbuilder URL `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

6. Create your first flow with the [Quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

For upgrade information, see the [Release notes](/release-notes).

For information about optional dependency groups and support for custom dependencies to extend Langbuilder OSS functionality, see [Install custom dependencies](/install-custom-dependencies).
