## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rotate all credentials** that were in the original files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review GCP audit logs** for the actionbridge project
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor OpenAI usage** for unauthorized activity

### Long-term
- Use secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD
- Regular credential rotation policy
- Least-privilege access principles
