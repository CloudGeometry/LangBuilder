# Pyodide Optimization - Frontend Performance Fix

## Problem
The frontend was downloading/installing Python packages (Pyodide) on every restart, taking 60+ seconds each time.

## Solution
Created an optimized caching system that checks if packages are already downloaded before running the expensive download process.

## What was changed:

### 1. New Script: `scripts/prepare-pyodide-fast.js`
- **Smart caching**: Only downloads packages if cache is missing or older than 7 days
- **Fast validation**: Simple file existence checks instead of complex package validation
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if packages can't be installed

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Changed `npm run dev` to use `pyodide:check` instead of `pyodide:fetch`
- `pyodide:check` uses the new fast script
- Original `pyodide:fetch` still available for force refresh

## Performance Improvement:
- **Before**: 60+ seconds every restart (downloading packages)
- **After**: ~0.2 seconds when cache is valid âœ…

## Usage:

### Normal development (uses cache):
```bash
npm run dev
# Uses pyodide:check - very fast if cache exists
```

### Force refresh packages:
```bash
npm run pyodide:fetch
# Downloads fresh packages (use if you need to update packages)
```

## Cache Location:
- `static/pyodide/` - Contains cached Python packages
- Cache is valid for 7 days, then auto-refreshes
- Safe to delete if you want to force a refresh

## Benefits:
1. **Much faster startup** - No more waiting for Python package downloads
2. **Offline development** - Works without internet once packages are cached
3. **Bandwidth savings** - Packages only downloaded when needed
4. **Backwards compatible** - Original behavior available via `npm run pyodide:fetch`

Your frontend should now start much faster! ðŸš€
